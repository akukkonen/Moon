Above here are the first screen users will see when they would open the application. They are first presented with the basic choice between logging in or creating an account.

Above here is one of the main tasks of the application, the emissions tracking. User can switch between two timeframes and see some fun statistics about the amount of emissions they have cut back on.

Above are two screens from the second main task of the app. In that task, users can set their starting point and destination, and the app will show them the duration, length and  emissions of different transport options. The third screen is of the settings of the app.
