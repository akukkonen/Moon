<center> I made this prototype for my  User Interface Design course, where we were tasked with coming up with an app that would promote sustainable transportation and design a user interface for it. This was a group project and we came up with the idea for the application together, but the rest of the prototype was done entirely by me. The idea of the application is to let the user track their carbon footprint that is caused by transportation and show them how much emissions different transportation cause and try to get them to make more eco-friendly choices. 
    
The thing i enjoyed most in this project was trying different things and seeing what worked. For example the navigation panel was not originally at the bottom, but was moved there after a little benchmarking of different applications. I also enjoyed with trying to create a visually appealing interface from the moodboard our group created, mainly by utilizing the colour green. 

Made with Adobe XD. </center>

Above here are the first screen users will see when they would open the application. They are first presented with the basic choice between logging in or creating an account.

Above here is one of the main tasks of the application, the emissions tracking. User can switch between two timeframes and see some fun statistics about the amount of emissions they have cut back on.

Above are two screens from the second main task of the app. In that task, users can set their starting point and destination, and the app will show them the duration, length and  emissions of different transport options. The third screen is of the settings of the app.
