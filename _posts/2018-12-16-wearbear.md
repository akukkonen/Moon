<center> I made this prototype for my Software Business course. We were supposed to come up with a new business idea for an app, and our group came up with an app where people can rent and put up for rent their formal wear, kind of like an "AirBnB for formal wear". Made with Adobe XD. </center>

{% include gallery images=images cols=2 %}

Above are two screens, where the first is the search function, where user chooses what sort of Formal wear they are looking for and for what timeframe. The second screen is where the user is taken when they have selected their search parameters. There they can view the available suits and dresses that fit their search parameters.

{% endcapture %}
{% include gallery images=images caption="White tie renting app" cols=3 %}

The first photo of these three is the one where user has selected what suit they want to rent and has clicked on its picture. There they can view the information that the suit's owner has put in the system. From this view the user can either message the owner for further information (like in the next screen) or move to confirming the rental and paying for it (third picture).
