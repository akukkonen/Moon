## Hi there!

I'm a 5th year student at Tampere University of Technology, majoring in Information and Knowledge Management. I'm very interested in visual design and would love to work in that field in the future. I have a fair amount of experience from personal projects and I have done plenty of design work (posters, Facebook event cover photos, brochures) for different student organisations and events at my university. I have also designed a couple of UI prototypes for some software engineering  courses during my studies. I have also completed a Udemy online course about UI design, which further indicates my interest in the subject.

My tools of the trade are:
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe XD
* Adobe Indesign
