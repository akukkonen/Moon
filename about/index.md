## Hi there!

I'm finishing my studies in Tampere University where I study Information and Knowledge Management. I'm interested in UI and UX design and would love to work in that field in the future. I have a fair amount of experience from personal projects and I have done plenty of design work (posters, Facebook event cover photos, brochures) for different student organisations and events at my university. I have also designed a couple of UI prototypes for software engineering  courses during my studies and completed a Udemy online course about UI design, which further indicates my interest in the subject. 

My tools of the trade are:
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe XD
* Adobe Indesign

You can check out my CV for further information:
