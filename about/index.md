## Hi there!

I'm a 5th year student at Tampere University of Technology where I study Information and Knowledge Management. I'm very interested in visual design and would love to work in that field in the future. I have a fair amount of experience from personal projects and I have done plenty of design work (posters, Facebook event cover photos, brochures) for different student organisations and events at my university. I have also designed a couple of UI prototypes for some software engineering  courses during my studies and completed a Udemy online course about UI design, which further indicates my interest in the subject.

My tools of the trade are:
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe XD
* Adobe Indesign

Check out my CV for further information:
